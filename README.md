# Rocket Launch Countdown Admin ðŸš€

[![CI](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/endorhq/node-demo/ci.yml?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/endorhq/node-demo/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Endor Dev](https://img.shields.io/badge/endor-dev_/_test-purple?style=flat-square)](https://docs.endor.dev/cli/overview/)

A space-themed NodeJS demo application for managing rocket launch countdowns. Built with Fastify and Prisma, featuring a clean and simple interface for creating, viewing, and managing countdown timers for upcoming rocket launches.

It uses [Endor](https://docs.endor.dev/cli/overview/) to run a Postgres database for development. You do not need to install any additional software, as Endor is like any other Node dependency.

## Features

- âœ… Create and manage rocket launch countdowns
- âœ… Live countdown timers with days, hours, minutes, and seconds
- âœ… RESTful API for programmatic access
- âœ… Simple, responsive web interface
- âœ… No authentication required (simplified admin panel)
- âœ… PostgreSQL database support via Prisma ORM

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Fastify
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. Run with Endor
- **Frontend**: Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Template Engine**: EJS
- **Testing**: Node.js built-in test runner

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+

npm run test:integration  # Run integration tests only
```

### Continuous Integration

This project includes GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing:

- **CI Pipeline**: Runs on every push and pull request
  - Tests on Node.js 20.x and 22.x
  - Uses Endor to spin up PostgreSQL for integration tests
  - Includes unit tests, integration tests, and code quality checks
  - Falls back to containerized PostgreSQL if Endor fails

The CI configuration can be found in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Database Schema

You can find it on the `prisma/schema.prisma` file.
