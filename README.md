# Rocket Launch Countdown Admin ðŸš€

A space-themed NodeJS demo application for managing rocket launch countdowns. Built with Fastify and Prisma, featuring a clean and simple interface for creating, viewing, and managing countdown timers for upcoming rocket launches.

It uses [Endor](https://docs.endor.dev/cli/overview/) to run a Postgres database for development. You do not need to install any additional software, as Endor is like any other Node dependency.

- âœ… No authentication required (simplified admin panel)
- âœ… PostgreSQL database support via Prisma ORM
